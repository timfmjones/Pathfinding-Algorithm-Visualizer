# React Path Finding Visualization App
Welcome to the React Path Finding Algorithm Visualization App! This react application allows users to interactively visualize various pathfinding algorithms, with a focus on Dijkstra's algorithm. This README provides an overview of the project structure, how to run the app, and customization options.

## Features
Visualize Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding.
Interactive grid for user-defined start and target nodes.
Adjustable animation speed for better understanding.
Ability to add obstacles to observe algorithm adaptability.

## Getting Started
### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/timfmjones/Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualizer.git`

### Change to the project directory:
`cd pathfinding-visualization`


### Install dependencies:
`npm install`

### Running the App
Start the development server:
`npm start`
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200 to view the app.

## Usage
### Selecting Algorithms
Choose the desired algorithm from the dropdown menu and observe how it finds the shortest path between the start and target nodes.

### Adjusting Speed
Use the speed slider to control the animation speed of the algorithm, allowing for a more detailed or faster visualization.

### Adding Obstacles
Click on the grid cells to add obstacles. These obstacles challenge the algorithm to find an optimal path around them.

### Customization
Feel free to customize the app to suit your needs. You can modify the grid size, add additional pathfinding algorithms, or enhance the user interface.
